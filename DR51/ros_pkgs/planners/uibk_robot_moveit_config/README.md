UIBK Robot MoveIt! Configuration
================================

This package contains a clean moveit configuration of the moveit package for the UIBK Robot.

It is meant to be used as an interface to moveit through the moveit GUI in Rviz.

Note that, in the `demo.launch`, the robot listens to the `/golem/joint_states` to have feedback of the real robot through the golem controller.
